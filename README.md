# stackpy
StackOverflow command line client written in Python.

# Usage
### command line options

`-s`, `--search`  --> text to search  
`-t`, `--tags`    --> tags to search  
`-v`, `--version` --> print version and exit  
`-i`, `--info`    --> print info and exit  

### example
**Note:** you can make `stackpy.py` executable file and then create link to it, so you can use `stackpy` instead of `python stackpy.py`  
`python stackpy.py -s "How to install pip?" -t "python"`
